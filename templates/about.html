            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Autism Ally aims to demystify the myth, especially among black Africans, that autism is a result of being bewitched. People need to understand that a person's genes can interact with aspects of their environment to affect development in ways that lead to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We are committed to creating a community where people understand that autism is a different ability, and with the right support, individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives.</p>

        <section class="vision">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a world where autism is understood and accepted as a natural variation of the human experience. By raising awareness, dispelling myths, and providing support, we aim to foster a society that celebrates neurodiversity and provides the resources needed for individuals with autism and their families to thrive.</p>
